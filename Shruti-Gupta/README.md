### Project Overview

 We are reading a bunch of words (some conditions need to be met) from different files and then writing it into a separate file.
So basically we have encrypted our message so that not everyone who is having the files can read our message.



### Learnings from the project

 Learn how to send an encrypted message with the help of the very basics of Python and along with that have learned a few new functions such as filter(), join() etc.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Follow the step by step approach and then debug the errors


### Challenges faced

 Pre-written code at the end makes the 'variable not defined' at the beginning of code and along with that, all the variables are of the same name just a difference of a prefix which I ignored while reading the error and took a lot of time to figure out the real issue.


### Additional pointers

 Just comment everything and then start writing your code will solve a lot more of your problems :)
